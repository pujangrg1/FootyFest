# Assets Folder

## Logo Placement

Please add your "FOOTY FEST" logo image to this folder with the filename:
- `footy-fest-logo.png`

The logo should be:
- PNG format (or JPG if needed)
- Recommended size: 400x400px or larger (will be scaled down)
- Transparent background preferred

## Current Logo

The app expects the logo at: `assets/images/footy-fest-logo.png`

If you need to use a different filename or format, update the import in:
- `src/screens/auth/LoginScreen.js`
